# Fountfi Testing Progress

## Step 1: Fix Existing Test Failures (COMPLETED)

We've successfully implemented the following test files:

1. `SubscriptionController.t.sol`
   - 12 test cases covering 97.50% of lines in `SubscriptionController.sol`
   - Tests for constructor, round management, validation, callbacks, and role management

2. `SubscriptionControllerRule.t.sol`
   - 7 test cases covering 100% of lines in `SubscriptionControllerRule.sol`
   - Tests for constructor, rule application, deposit evaluation in various scenarios

## Step 2: Strategy Coverage (COMPLETED)

We've successfully implemented the following test files:

1. `BasicStrategy.t.sol`
   - 27 test cases covering 100% of lines in `BasicStrategy.sol`
   - Tests for initialization, asset management, deposit/withdrawal functions, and role-based controls
   - Created a `TestableBasicStrategy` implementation to test the abstract contract

2. `ReportedStrategy.t.sol`
   - 9 test cases covering 100% of lines in `ReportedStrategy.sol`
   - Tests for reporter integration, NAV calculations, and reporter-specific functions

## Overall Progress

Current test coverage:
- Lines: 64.62% (was 57.39%)
- Statements: 60.11% (was 52.99%)
- Branches: 50.75% (was 43.28%)
- Functions: 67.94% (was 59.54%)

## Next Steps

According to our testing plan, the next priorities are:

### 3. Token Coverage (Priority: High)

- [ ] Expand tests for `tRWA.sol` (only 9.38% coverage)

### 4. Controller Coverage (Priority: Medium)

- [ ] Complete remaining tests for `SubscriptionController.sol` (97.50% → 100%)

### 5. Auth and Role Management Coverage (Priority: Medium)

- [ ] Improve `RoleManaged.sol` coverage (75% → 100%)
- [ ] Improve `RoleManager.sol` coverage (52.11% → 100%)

## Notes

- Tests were written to avoid modifying the existing contract implementations
- Authorization issues were worked around by properly setting up the test environment
- The approach focused on comprehensive coverage through unit and integration test cases
