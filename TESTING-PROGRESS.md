# Fountfi Testing Progress

## Step 1: Fix Existing Test Failures (COMPLETED)

We've successfully implemented the following test files:

1. `SubscriptionController.t.sol`
   - 12 test cases covering 97.50% of lines in `SubscriptionController.sol`
   - Tests for constructor, round management, validation, callbacks, and role management

2. `SubscriptionControllerRule.t.sol`
   - 7 test cases covering 100% of lines in `SubscriptionControllerRule.sol`
   - Tests for constructor, rule application, deposit evaluation in various scenarios

## Step 2: Strategy Coverage (COMPLETED)

We've successfully implemented the following test files:

1. `BasicStrategy.t.sol`
   - 27 test cases covering 100% of lines in `BasicStrategy.sol`
   - Tests for initialization, asset management, deposit/withdrawal functions, and role-based controls
   - Created a `TestableBasicStrategy` implementation to test the abstract contract

2. `ReportedStrategy.t.sol`
   - 9 test cases covering 100% of lines in `ReportedStrategy.sol`
   - Tests for reporter integration, NAV calculations, and reporter-specific functions

## Step 3: Token Coverage (IN PROGRESS)

We've made significant progress on expanding tests for `tRWA.sol`:

1. `tRWA.t.sol`
   - Created 29 test cases for the token implementation
   - Tests cover:
     - Constructor functionality and validation
     - Basic ERC20/ERC4626 operations (deposit, mint)
     - Controller integration
     - Rules integration
     - Callback functionality
     - Withdrawal queueing
     - Virtual shares handling (ERC4626 inflation protection)
   - Currently 15/29 tests passing successfully
   - Current coverage increased from 9.38% to approximately 65-70%
   - Remaining challenges with ERC4626 virtual shares testing

## Overall Progress

Current test coverage:
- Lines: ~72% (was 64.62%)
- Statements: ~68% (was 60.11%)
- Branches: ~58% (was 50.75%)
- Functions: ~75% (was 67.94%)

## Next Steps

According to our testing plan, the next priorities are:

### 3. Token Coverage (Priority: High)

- [x] Expand tests for `tRWA.sol` (coverage improved from 9.38% to ~70%)
- [ ] Fix remaining test failures in tRWA.t.sol

### 4. Controller Coverage (Priority: Medium)

- [ ] Complete remaining tests for `SubscriptionController.sol` (97.50% → 100%)

### 5. Auth and Role Management Coverage (Priority: Medium)

- [ ] Improve `RoleManaged.sol` coverage (75% → 100%)
- [ ] Improve `RoleManager.sol` coverage (52.11% → 100%)

## Notes

- Tests were written to avoid modifying the existing contract implementations
- Authorization issues were worked around by properly setting up the test environment 
- ERC4626 implementation in tRWA includes virtual shares protection that makes unit testing challenging
- The approach focused on comprehensive coverage through unit and integration test cases
