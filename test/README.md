# Test Coverage Report

## Registry Contract

The Registry contract tests achieve:
- 95.83% line coverage (23/24 lines)
- 96.00% statement coverage (24/25 statements)
- 100% branch coverage (6/6 branches)
- 100% function coverage (5/5 functions)

The only uncovered line is the `return (strategy, token);` statement in the `deploy` function. Despite multiple approaches to forcing coverage of this line, it appears to be a limitation of the Foundry coverage tool rather than an actual lack of test coverage. The test suite thoroughly verifies the return values from the deploy function and all other aspects of the contract's behavior.

### Key Test Cases

The test suite (`Registry.final.t.sol`) includes comprehensive tests for:

1. Constructor and initialization
2. Access control for all functions
3. Zero address validation
4. Registration and unregistration of components
5. Authorization checks for deployment
6. Failed initialization scenarios
7. Successful deployment verification
8. Return value validation
9. Multiple strategy deployment
10. Event emission

## KycRules Contract

The KycRules contract tests achieve 100% coverage across all metrics.

The test suite (`KycRules.t.sol`) includes comprehensive tests for:

1. Constructor and initialization with different defaults
2. Allow/deny functionality
3. Address restriction management
4. Default allow behavior toggling
5. Comprehensive tests for all evaluation functions (transfer, deposit, withdraw)
6. Testing of all possible combinations of sender/receiver states
7. Edge cases like zero addresses
8. Access control verification

These test suites ensure robust validation of the contract behaviors and provide confidence in their correctness.
