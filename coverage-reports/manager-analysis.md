# Fountfi Manager Contracts Analysis

## Current Status

The following manager contracts have been implemented:

1. **WithdrawalManager.sol**
   - Core functionality implemented
   - Tests are failing with "Unauthorized" errors
   - 0% test coverage currently

2. **SubscriptionManager.sol**
   - Core functionality implemented
   - Tests are failing with "Unauthorized" errors
   - 0% test coverage currently

3. **MerkleHelper.sol**
   - Utility functions for Merkle tree operations
   - 0% test coverage currently

## Key Issues to Fix

1. **Authorization Issues**:
   - All manager tests are failing with "Unauthorized" errors
   - Need to fix role assignments in tests
   - Permission issues prevent proper test execution

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - 0% code coverage for manager contracts
   - Need working tests to verify functionality

3. **Interface Conflicts**:
   - Fixed compilation errors due to naming conflicts
   - ERC4626 and ItRWA interface conflicts resolved

## Next Steps

1. Fix test setup to address authorization issues
2. Implement proper role assignments in test setup
3. Fix remaining edge cases in manager contracts
4. Work through the tests methodically to ensure coverage
5. Document remaining work needed for full implementation
