Hi Claude, help me think through this design decision.

As you can tell by reading the code, we need to report the fund's AUM in an on-chain manner. Ultimately, the end goal is that we should be able to implement the `totalAssets` function in a tRWA token in a way that is compliant with the ERC4626 spec.

In a ReportedStrategy, the way we get this value is:

1) A privileged address calls `AumOracleReporter#update` with the fund's total AUM
2) The strategy delegates `ReportedStrategy#balance` to `AumOracleReporter#report`, which returns the AUM
3) The tRWA token delegates `tRWA#totalAssets` to `ReportedStrategy#balance`, which returns that same value.

This has advantages, of allowing the off-chain reporting in the most "natural" value, the AUM, and keeping everything accounted for in the denominator of `ERC4626#_asset` (the underlying asset) of the vault.

However, things get a bit tricky when trying to figure out how deposits and withdrawals affect `tRWA#totalAssets`. Theoretically, deposits and withdrawals should have an instant effect on AUM - howevever, when using reporting that effect won't actually be reflected on chain until the AUM is updated manually. This can create issues when, for instance, AUM is not updated manually between on-chain interactions subsequent deposits and withdrawals that might affect the AUM.

What sorts of issues might arise by forgetting to manually update AUM in the described scenario? Please be comprehensive and consider all scenarios. Given these issues, how would you mitigate against them?



So, I thought of another accounting method which might mitigate this - can you review this with a critical lens, let me know the pros and cons, and give your overall opinion?

Instead of reporting the total AUM in `ReportedStrategy#balance`, we could instead report the "price per share" - that is, the AUM divided by the number of circulating `tRWA` tokens. In this, alternative flow, we wold get `tRWA#totalAssets` through the following steps:

1) A privileged address calls `AumOracleReporter#update` with the fund's total AUM
2) The strategy divides `AumOracleReporter#report` by `tRWA#totalSupply` to get the price per outstanding share of he tRWA, and makes this value available in `ReportedStrategy#pricePerShare`.
3) To get `totalAssets`, the tRWA token multiplies `ReportedStrategy#pricePerShare` by `tRWA#totalSupply`.

The thinking behind this idea is that, when deposits/withdrawals happen in between NAV updates, those deposits and withdrawals have a smaller implicit effect on the "price per share" of a fund, as opposed to the fund's AUM. For instance, if there are 1000 shares outstanding and a fund's AUM is $1,000,000, then `totalAssets` is 1000000 and the price per share is 1000. If a new user comes along and deposits $500,000, then the fund's AUM is now $1,500,000 - a 50% delta. However, if we mint the user 500 new shares at the current price per share, then `pricePerShare` remains unchanged, meaning that `totalAssets` immediately reflects the new AUM of 1500000 (since `totalSupply` will have increased to 1500 shares outstanding).

As mentioned in the beginning, please let me know the pros and cons of this approach as opposed to AUM-based accounting, and share your overall opinion.



Hi Claude, I'm thinking about the way we report a strategy's balance in terms of `pricePerShare`. This seems to cause some repeat divisions/multiplications by `tRWA#totalSupply`, and in general seems a bit indirect. I'm thinking of changing the `totalAssets` calculation to be as straightforward as possible, and use the total AUM as a denominator. So, I would change the way we get `tRWA#totalAssets` to follow:

1) A privileged address calls `AumOracleReporter#update` with the fund's total AUM
2) The strategy delegates `ReportedStrategy#balance` to `AumOracleReporter#report`, which returns the AUM
3) The tRWA token delegates `tRWA#totalAssets` to `ReportedStrategy#balance`, which returns that same value.

This means that we wouldn't need things like decimal conversions, redundant division/multiplication, and the reporting would be more straightforward (just report the fund's AUM, a basic value that every fund understands).

Can you consider this alternative approach with a critical lens, let me know the pros and cons, and give your overall opinion?
